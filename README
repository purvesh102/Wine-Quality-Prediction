PROBLEM STATEMENT
Need to analyse the data set band predict the quality of wine.

Libraries:-
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn

Algorithms:-
Logistic Regression
KNN
SVC
Decision Tree
Random Forest


Conclusion:-
 By doing the analysis we came to know that high quality of wine required low volatile acidity, high citric acid and high alcohol contain and residual sugar range 
 should be between 2.5 to 3. After creating some model Random Forest model shows 89% accuracy thus Random Forest fits the best for my dataset.
